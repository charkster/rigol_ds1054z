# rigol_ds1054z class functions were writen to allow the high-level script
#  to be easy to read. Values with units are passed as strings, where the
#  unit can be stripped and converted to a base-10 value to be multiplied
#  by the value passed with it. This script sets up I2C decoding on the scope
#  to demonstrate triggering on SDA data (you don't need a slave device,
#  the scope is just observing the master write out to the bus)
